Customers who order from your WordPress e-commerce store are added to your Zendesk help desk after checkout.

== Description ==

This plugin integrates [Shopp](http://shopplugin.net) with [Zendesk](http://www.zendesk.com).

After checkout, a customer's email, name, and phone number will be added to your Zendesk.

This process occurs in the background without needing action from the user.

With Shopp + Zendesk you no longer need to enter this information in manually. It is done automatically with each order.
